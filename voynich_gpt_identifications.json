Surrounding these are elongated, reddish, spike-like structures.\n\n**Comparison to Real Plants:**\n- The illustration might loosely resemble a plant from the Apiaceae family, like anise or dill, but with exaggerated and fantastical elements.\n\n**Stylistic Traditions:**\n- Follows medieval herbal manuscript traditions of stylization and symbolic representation rather than strict botanical accuracy, similar to works like the \"Circa Instans\" or \"Tacuinum Sanitatis.\"\n\n**Unusual/Fantastical Elements:**\n- The exaggerated flower cluster and bulbous structures, along with the unusual spike-like elements, deviate from naturalistic representation, adding a mythical or symbolic aspect to the depiction.",
  "036_page180_13.jpeg": "The illustrated plant features a central woody stem with a branching pattern. The roots are visible and appear robust and spreading. The leaves are arranged in dense, fluffy clusters, with a somewhat rounded shape and a soft texture.\n\nComparing to medieval herbal manuscript traditions, the style resembles that of the \"Tacuinum Sanitatis\" or late medieval herbals which often prioritize symbolic or simplified forms over detailed realism. The plant might be an artistic interpretation of plants like rosemary or lavender, known for small clustered leaves.\n\nUnusual or fantastical elements might include the exaggerated fluffiness of the leaves and the symmetrical branching, which deviates from naturalistic representation.
