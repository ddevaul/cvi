Probably you'd want to run the stuff in this order
/initial_segmentation_original (not used later)
/image_segmentation_sam3 -- these outputs are used
/image_embeddings
/clustering
/roundness 

However, if you want to download any of the intermediate files, they're available at 
the google drive either under Voynich, Tractatus or Erbario.
