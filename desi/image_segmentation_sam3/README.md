This might be more easily run on colab to use GPU.

# Dirs needed:
voynich_plant_images/
tractatus_plant_images/
erbario_plant_images/
(you might already have these if you did the top level readme in /desi)
if not, they are available:
1. download plant_images.zip from https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gAW9hVp0wiMoZj_wXv2qeqRV3tLmf0xL/view?usp=drive_link
2. download erbario.zip from https://drive.google.com/file/d/1meeoYCeNGJg7g46QniBXcUr1dKY_M6te/view?usp=drive_link 
3. download tractatus.zip from https://drive.google.com/file/d/124tKxYaS6bRgjeTTsG-XYvvXjL47kG3M/view?usp=drive_link 

Then unzip them into properly named stuff. 

the output from this section is 
(voynich/erbario/tractatus)_plant_images_(leaf/plant/flower)_masks/ 
and 
(voynich/erbario/tractatus)_plant_images_(leaf/plant/flower)_cleaned/

again, these are available on the google drive under voynich/ erbario/ and tractatus/
